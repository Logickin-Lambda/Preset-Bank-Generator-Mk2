# SunVox Preset Bank Generator Mk2

This is an updated preset bank generator by Logickin and acheney, in order to provide an eco-system to maximize the current patch card and patch bank system in SunVox, so you can use acheney patach cards for storing any single mutable preset, or compress them into Logickin's highly compressed preset bank from the former c++ program for out of the box patch changing experience.

This Program can now be run using pixilang, which is a programming language made by the developer of SunVox, NightRadio. The reason to the choice of this lanauge is that it has the built-in SunVox library, so that the program can be updated effortlessly due to lack of external binding like java and rust, while it has covered every platforms, **EXCEPT for iOS**. Thus, users in the Warmplace (SunVox and pixilang) community can use the program everywhere, unless you have gotten yourself a fanzy iPhone or iPad (which I am using...).
